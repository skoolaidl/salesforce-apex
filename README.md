# salesforce-apex
Attempts at writing REST endpoints using Salesforce Apex.

Working endpoints are GET, POST, and DELETE on the Contact(s) object. Code can be found in [force-app/main/default/classes](https://github.com/skoolaidl/salesforce-apex/tree/main/Apex-Project-Slayton/force-app/main/default/classes)


Requires setting up a salesforce account, creating a sandbox, and connecting to an API Platform (such as Postman) to execute. I will attempt to create instructions to do so.
